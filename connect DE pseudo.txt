for each DE:
    recheck if still DE:
        test 4 dirs
            only one grid is dot, others are wall
                (posibility to store DE dir)

    init selection stack            
    for each dir:
        if candidate (bridge) is wall
        bridge is not out
        prolong in the same direction -> test
            test must not be out
            test must be dot
            test most not be in a room
            if both true: 
                find number of connections (number of dot grids for 4 dirs) is exactly 2 (from, to)
                bridge is possible, push it on selection stack
    check selection stack
    if length, create random dot
    else push DE on another stack

for each DE:
    check if DE, if true:
        make candidates: bridges
            Filter if out
            filter if dot
            same dir proximity to dot (filter if not)
            filter connections are == 2 
        check candidate stack
        if length, create random dot
        else push DE on another stack
